                    <p2>I'm assuming you've atleast skimmed the general information page if you've clicked here.
                        If not, you can still read but might be slightly lost, so read at your own discretion.<br><br>
                        The history of Tolkien's fantasy world is rich in anything a fantasy lover could ask for.
                        To start off, Tolkien first created a language before even starting his books.
                        It was the language of his elven characters and only once that was completed did he begin to craft an entire world to create his dream.
                        What other author can claim that they fleshed out an entire world and language just for the fun of it, and the proceed to write a fantasy epic in said world?<br><br>
                        Not only that, but the characters in his books are interesting and develop throughout the story (unlike some famous literature)
                        The characters in both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings range from literal kings of huge nations, such as Théoden, all the way down to hobbits like Frodo, yet both face similar challenges. 
                        Théoden must decide between what’s best for Middle Earth or to protect his people, while Frodo is forced between carrying his burden to his doom or the choice of saving himself. 
                        Things like this inject humanity and empathy into characters we might otherwise feel little for.<br><br>
                        Here were just a pieces of lore from LOTR and I hope you found yourself atleast mildly intrigued!
