        <p>Do you remember the stories you read as a child? 
            Those tales of fantasy and bravery; the wonder of strange lands which you remember fondly to this day. 
            For me, that story was told by J.R.R. Tolkien. The Hobbit, along with The Lord of The Rings Trilogy, has been integral to the fantasy genre since their conceptions in 1932 and 1948, respectively. 
            It has been through these works that Tolkienâ€™s ideas have lived on in our overall consciousness and most likely why you're here right now!</p>
